MUST READ: Legacy Lectures
DON'T SKIP THIS!

---

With React 16.8, a new feature called "React Hooks" was introduced. This course already covers this feature and this module, up to this point, is 100% up-to-date with that feature (e.g. you learned about useEffect()).

The upcoming lectures marked as "[LEGACY]" are only there to allow existing students who started this module before the update (on February 6th) to continue smoothly.

You can skip all remaining lectures in this module (i.e. the lectures with "[LEGACY]") if you watched all the other lectures prior to this one.
